EVERY PLAN IS TO BE CONSIDERED, EVERY EXPEDIENT TRIED AND EVERY METHOD TAKEN BEFORE MATTERS ARE BROUGHT TO THIS LAST EXTREMITY.

MY LOVE FOR THE ROMAN EMPIRE IS UNDENIABLY GREATER THAN FOR MYSELF. THE GREATEST EMPIRE EVER TO HAVE EXISTED. I PLEDGE MY ETERNAL SERVITUDE AND I AM FOREVER BOUND TO SERVE IT, IN LIFE AND IN DEATH. THEY HAVE MERELY GIVEN US: ROADS, CENTRAL HEATING, CONCRETE, THE CALENDAR, AND FLUSHING TOILETS AND SEWERS.
